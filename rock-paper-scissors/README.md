   1. Javascript

## SetUp Instructions
   1. Open the 'index.html' file from the root directory in a browser of your choice ( recommended: Chrome. FireFox, or Safari)

   2. Right click on mouse and select your inspect and then open up your console. We are going to be doing this whole project through the inspect and console.

## How to use as a Typical User
Once the landing page is open, it will be blank. You will then open up your inspect and open the console. A welcome message appears stating "Let's play Rock, Paper, Scissors!" You will be propmted to select r for rock, p for paper, or s for scissors to start the game. Once the selection has been entered you will see that what the computer has picked and it will display what you chose and then whether you've won, you've lost, or you've tied. After each round of the game is played, it displays a tally of how many wins, loses, and ties.
